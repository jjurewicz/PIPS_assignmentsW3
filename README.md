# PIPS_assignmentsW3
This is a R repository made as a part of Programming in Psychological Science course assignments.
The repository consists of 3 functions: remind_me(), cheat(), make_art()

# Usage 

remind_me() takes no arguments and returns important dates that I should not forget. 

cheat() takes one argument (exercise_nr) and returns the solution to that exercise. 

Example:
cheat(1)

Output:

    grades <- rnorm(60, mean = 7, sd = 1.5)
    grade_graph <- hist(grades)

    grade_graph
    
    
make_art() takes 2 arguments: random seed and the number of rings the user wants their art piece to have

Example:

make_art(10, 5)
